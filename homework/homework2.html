Homework: Homework 2 
    <p>Headings: tags < h1 > through < h6 > are designed to notify headings on your webpage. There should only be one h1 tag per webpage and we should not skip designations, meaning we should not jump from h1 to h3 immediately.
        <h1>h1</h1>
        <h2>h2</h2>
        <h3>h3</h3>
        <h4>h4</h4>
        <h5>h5</h5>
        <h6>h6</h6>
    </p>
    The < body > tag indicates the body
    The < br > tag
