Homework: Homework 2 
    <p>Headings: tags < h1 > through < h6 > are designed to notify headings on your webpage. There should only be one h1 tag per webpage and we should not skip designations, meaning we should not jump from h1 to h3 immediately.
        <h1>h1</h1>
        <h2>h2</h2>
        <h3>h3</h3>
        <h4>h4</h4>
        <h5>h5</h5>
        <h6>h6</h6>
    </p>
    <br> <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>< body >: Similar to the html tag, there can only be one body tag per document. It is used to indicated everything that is within the html document such as paragraphs, images, headings, lists and everything else.</li>
        <li>< br >: This tag has no end tag and is used to indicate a line break on the page.</li>
        <li>< p >: Used to indicated a paragraph, browsers will add a single blank line before and after each p tag.</li>
        <li>< a href >: is used to add a hyper link to another webpage from your webpage. The href part of this element is used to indicated the intended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQnoZUR6fvY">destination</a> for a link. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ordered List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>< ul >: Will add an unordered list, using bullet points to dictate each item.</li>
        <li>< ol >: Will add an ordered list using either numerals or the alphabet to indicate items on the list.</li>
        <li>< li >: This tag and it's end tag are required before and after every item on each list, either ordered or unordered, in order to let the code know that it is, in fact, an item on the list.</li>
        <li>< img >: This tag is used to embed images onto HTML pages. According to <a href="w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>, the img tag has two required attributes:
        <br> src = Defines the path to the images
        <br>alt = Adds alternate text for the image for screen readers or if the image cannot be displayed for some reason</li>
        <li>< strong >: Used to accentuate important text that will usually be <strong>bolded</strong>.</li>
        <li>nbsp: The nonbreaking space entity in html. </li>
    </ol>
